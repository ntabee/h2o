H2O-tile: an H2O-based special-purpose HTTPD for OpenStreetMap tile server.
===

This is
--
- aimed at serving *already-prepared* tiles very quick
- *NOT* aimed at *on-demand rendering* non-existent tiles very quick

As such, the implementation does not adopt so-called *meta-tiles* as the storage format:
tiles are stored just as individual .png files.
(pros./cons. of this approach will be explained in near future... when?)

Status
--
At the very moment, a quick setup script is placed at `examples/tile-demo`, 
it builds a tiny demo-purpose tile server, covering a small region around Tokyo, Japan.

A brief instruction of the setup is in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

A [live demo](http://h2o-tile-demo.ddns.net:8080/) is running on Amazon EC2
